The project is about implementing several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. Then choosing the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimizing this algorithm to best model the data. The goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.
